	Use:   "delete remote:path",
	Short: `Remove the contents of path.`,
	Long: `
Remove the contents of path.  Unlike ` + "`" + `purge` + "`" + ` it obeys include/exclude
filters so can be used to selectively delete files.

Eg delete all files bigger than 100MBytes

Check what would be deleted first (use either)

    rclone --min-size 100M lsl remote:path
    rclone --dry-run --min-size 100M delete remote:path

Then delete

    rclone --min-size 100M delete remote:path

That reads "delete everything with a minimum size of 100 MB", hence
delete all files bigger than 100MBytes.
