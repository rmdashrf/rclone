	Use:   "move source:path dest:path",
	Short: `Move files from source to dest.`,
	Long: `
Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination
directory. Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap and
the remote does not support a server side directory move operation.

If no filters are in use and if possible this will server side move
` + "`source:path`" + ` into ` + "`dest:path`" + `. After this ` + "`source:path`" + ` will no
longer longer exist.

Otherwise for each file in ` + "`source:path`" + ` selected by the filters (if
any) this will move it into ` + "`dest:path`" + `.  If possible a server side
move will be used, otherwise it will copy it (server side if possible)
into ` + "`dest:path`" + ` then delete the original (if no errors on copy) in
` + "`source:path`" + `.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
--dry-run flag.
